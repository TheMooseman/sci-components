A component in Science Design System needs to be flexible enough that it can be used across a wide range of scenarios and shouldn't be constrained to a specific number of products.

## Visual

Provide a screenshot or link to a prototype of your component proposal.

## Context

Where and when might this proposed component be used?

## Owner

Is this something you and your product has time to do or is this a request of the Science Design System team?

## State

Does this component have states? If so, what are the different states (e.g. accordion with closed/open states)?

## Progressive enhancement

A component should be designed small screen first. How does this component scale up?
How will this component degrade on less competent browsers?
